# DevOps Lab 🐧

> *Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Raheem*  
> A hands-on DevOps learning journey — from Linux CLI to CI/CD, microservices, and cloud.

## 📂 Structure
- `docs/` – Learning journal & weekly summaries
- `scripts/` – Automation tools (e.g., log analyzer)
- `logs/` – Sample log files (not committed if sensitive)
- `projects/` – Backend microservices

## 🛠️ Week 1 Focus
- Linux CLI & filesystem navigation
- File permissions & user/group security
- Log analysis with `grep`, `awk`, and Bash

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Containerize services with Docker
- Automate deployments with GitHub Actions
- Provision cloud infrastructure with Terraform

*Alhamdulillah for knowledge. May it serve humanity.*
